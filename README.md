## Resources

* [A re-introduction to JavaScript (JS tutorial)] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) - This article was a lifesaver. I used it as a resource on every step of this homework if I couldn't find an answer in my lecture notes. I used it to check that I was writing each item correctly and using colons, semicolons, brackets, etc. at the right times. It gave great, to-the-point answers for me. This is a page I will come back to frequently when writing JavaScript in the future.

## Comments

This was a very difficult project for me - especially the latter portion. I used the lectures and the above article constantly, but I felt like my brain wasn't figuring out what you were looking for in some of these answers. I just couldn't connect completely, and I know they are not all completely accurate. But I did learn a lot along the way and am eager to see your comments and corrections.
